          This project features an implementation of the Selection Sort
          algorithm in C, applied to a randomly generated array of 50,000 unique
          integers. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from
          the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at the
          current position.</p><p> Although not the most efficient for large datasets
          due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity, this implementation demonstrates a
          fundamental sorting technique often used for educational purposes. The
          project includes additional arrays sorted in ascending, descending,
          and random order to provide a foundation for comparing the performance
          of different sorting algorithms.
